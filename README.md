### Optimising Compilers

Have a look at [optimising compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimizing_compiler)

Specific optimisations (that will be easier to implement):
- Loop unrolling
- Common subexpression elimination
- Constant folding and propagation
- induction variable analysis
- Loop interchange
- Dead store elimination
